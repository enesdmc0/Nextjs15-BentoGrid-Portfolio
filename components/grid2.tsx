        Hello! I am a software developer with a passion for technology and
        software development. I work with technologies like TypeScript,
        React.js, Next.js, and React Native to build web and mobile
        applications. I also have a strong interest in modern design principles
        and artificial intelligence, which I integrate into my projects whenever
        possible. Every new project is an opportunity for me to learn and
        further improve myself. <br /> <br /> Learning new technologies, exploring AI, and
        solving complex problems are the main factors that motivate me. I enjoy
        pushing my limits and facing new challenges. In every project, I do my
        best to deliver better, more efficient solutions while staying
        up-to-date with the latest trends in technology and design.
      </p>
